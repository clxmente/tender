Eggs are only an ingredient at locations that serve breakfast and only one menu item contains soy. Their allergen and special diets menu is very easy to use and understand and has excellent notes for added detail about ingredients. In addition to the top 8 allergens and gluten, Chipotle provides information for mustard and sulfites, as well as for those following a vegetarian, vegan, whole30, keto, or paleo diet.</p><p>Chipotle is happy to accomodate guests with critical dietary restrictions and looks to the customer for direction on any special handling they would like for their order. Upon request, gloves are changed and hands are washed. Unopened bins or unused product from the back can be used upon request for any guests concerned about cross-contact. You may request one staff member make your order, instead of passing it down the line. All items on the line have dedicated spoons/utensils so that cross-contact risk is reduced. The order is prepared right in front of you so you know everything that goes into it and can feel comfortable with the process. All locations are owned by the corporation so training, process, and ingredients are consistent. One negative is that there is no place to enter critical dietary restriction information when ordering online or through their app. Guests need to either call the location or visit in-person to communicate any critical dietary restriction needs.</p>",

Additionally, their items are made to order and guests can watch their order as it is made. Because of the robust allergen menu and made-to-order meals, Five Guys is a great restaurant for several dietary restrictions.</p><p>In our surveys, each location was consistent in their critical dietary restriction awareness and process. However, it would be nice if they had dedicated utensils for each burger topping, clearer protocol for cleaning the blender for critical dietary restriction orders, and a gluten-free bun for celiac and gluten sensitivity.</p><p>Because they get ingredients with a gloved hand, you'll need to ask them to pull your ingredients from fresh bins, which they have told us they are happy to do. If you get a milkshake, ask that they use fresh sanitizing wash to clean it really well before blending your shake.</p><p>One grill is used for cooking meat (contains dairy and hydrolyzed soy protein ingredients) and the other grill is used for wheat products (contains soy, sesame, dairy and egg-ingredients). The only items in the fryer are refined peanut oil and french fries. Other than 100% refined peanut oil, the fryer is free of gluten and all of the other top 8 allergens.</p>",

One cooks fish and chicken, the second cooks red meats and the third grill cooks pancakes, French toast and eggs. Dairy (butter) is used on all grills. The managers contacted by Picknic could not ensure that their grills were completely free of allergens. A few locations were willing to utilize new utensils, clean the grill and/or use pans to prepare foods for those with critical dietary restrictions, but it must be requested by the customer.</p><p>There are three fryers used. One fries fish and chicken and has cross-contact with fish, wheat, and egg. The second cooks breaded items like onion rings and has cross-contact with wheat and egg. The third fries cheese sticks and has cross-contact with dairy, wheat, and egg.</p><p>Denny’s has an informative allergen menu that designates if an item contains or may contain an allergen. There is also cross-contact information on the allergen menu and indicates if the item is processed in a facility or on equipment with an allergen. There is a further breakdown of information about tree nuts (almonds, coconut, hazelnut) and fish (anchovies, cod/pollock/white fish, salmon).</p><p>In summary, they have a wide menu, willingness to accommodate dietary restrictions, and an online allergen guide. However, their knowledge of critical dietary restrictions varied between locations and the restaurant chain does not have consistent procedures for handling critical dietary restrictions in the restaurants.</p>",

Additionally, they do not have separate ovens for different allergens so those with a gluten critical dietary restriction should be aware that their gluten-free pizza may come into contact with gluten-containing items in the oven or on the toppings bar.

Just be sure to ask the staff to wash their hands and get your ice cream from a fresh bin with fresh utensils. Otherwise, cross-contact is highly likely since the scoops used for ice cream and the wells for the scoops are shared. Toppings (including peanuts and tree nuts) are typically stored close together on the line, so there is an elevated risk of cross-contact between toppings.</p><p>The waffle cones offered are prepared in-house every day, whereas the sugar and cake cones are shipped from a factory. The waffle cones contain multiple allergens, including gluten, wheat, soy, eggs, and milk. The waffle irons are located in a separate area from the ice cream tubs and are produced in the morning to reduce risk of cross-contact.</p><p>Their online menu provides an easy-to-use filter to help customers navigate the menu according to their dietary restrictions or preferences, but not every flavor listed online is offered at every location.</p><p>The managers contacted by Picknic showed little knowledge regarding food allergies so you will need to be your own advocate. The procedures for accommodating critical dietary restrictions were not standardized across the reviewed facilities. There were discrepancies in the understanding of company policies and procedures; some locations did not require their employees to wear gloves when scooping ice cream, whereas other locations did require gloves.</p>",

Eggs are only an ingredient at locations that serve breakfast and only one menu item contains soy. Their allergen and special diets menu is very easy to use and understand and has excellent notes for added detail about ingredients. In addition to the top 8 allergens and gluten, Chipotle provides information for mustard and sulfites, as well as for those following a vegetarian, vegan, whole30, keto, or paleo diet.</p><p>Chipotle is happy to accomodate guests with critical dietary restrictions and looks to the customer for direction on any special handling they would like for their order. Upon request, gloves are changed and hands are washed. Unopened bins or unused product from the back can be used upon request for any guests concerned about cross-contact. You may request one staff member make your order, instead of passing it down the line. All items on the line have dedicated spoons/utensils so that cross-contact risk is reduced. The order is prepared right in front of you so you know everything that goes into it and can feel comfortable with the process. All locations are owned by the corporation so training, process, and ingredients are consistent. One negative is that there is no place to enter critical dietary restriction information when ordering online or through their app. Guests need to either call the location or visit in-person to communicate any critical dietary restriction needs.</p>",

One cooks fish and chicken, the second cooks red meats and the third grill cooks pancakes, French toast and eggs. Dairy (butter) is used on all grills. The managers contacted by Picknic could not ensure that their grills were completely free of allergens. A few locations were willing to utilize new utensils, clean the grill and/or use pans to prepare foods for those with critical dietary restrictions, but it must be requested by the customer.</p><p>There are three fryers used. One fries fish and chicken and has cross-contact with fish, wheat, and egg. The second cooks breaded items like onion rings and has cross-contact with wheat and egg. The third fries cheese sticks and has cross-contact with dairy, wheat, and egg.</p><p>Denny’s has an informative allergen menu that designates if an item contains or may contain an allergen. There is also cross-contact information on the allergen menu and indicates if the item is processed in a facility or on equipment with an allergen. There is a further breakdown of information about tree nuts (almonds, coconut, hazelnut) and fish (anchovies, cod/pollock/white fish, salmon).</p><p>In summary, they have a wide menu, willingness to accommodate dietary restrictions, and an online allergen guide.

Eggs are only an ingredient at locations that serve breakfast and only one menu item contains soy. Their allergen and special diets menu is very easy to use and understand and has excellent notes for added detail about ingredients. In addition to the top 8 allergens and gluten, Chipotle provides information for mustard and sulfites, as well as for those following a vegetarian, vegan, whole30, keto, or paleo diet.</p><p>Chipotle is happy to accomodate guests with critical dietary restrictions and looks to the customer for direction on any special handling they would like for their order. Upon request, gloves are changed and hands are washed. Unopened bins or unused product from the back can be used upon request for any guests concerned about cross-contact. You may request one staff member make your order, instead of passing it down the line. All items on the line have dedicated spoons/utensils so that cross-contact risk is reduced. The order is prepared right in front of you so you know everything that goes into it and can feel comfortable with the process. All locations are owned by the corporation so training, process, and ingredients are consistent. One negative is that there is no place to enter critical dietary restriction information when ordering online or through their app. Guests need to either call the location or visit in-person to communicate any critical dietary restriction needs.</p>",

Eggs are only an ingredient at locations that serve breakfast and only one menu item contains soy. Their allergen and special diets menu is very easy to use and understand and has excellent notes for added detail about ingredients. In addition to the top 8 allergens and gluten, Chipotle provides information for mustard and sulfites, as well as for those following a vegetarian, vegan, whole30, keto, or paleo diet.</p><p>Chipotle is happy to accomodate guests with critical dietary restrictions and looks to the customer for direction on any special handling they would like for their order. Upon request, gloves are changed and hands are washed. Unopened bins or unused product from the back can be used upon request for any guests concerned about cross-contact. You may request one staff member make your order, instead of passing it down the line. All items on the line have dedicated spoons/utensils so that cross-contact risk is reduced. The order is prepared right in front of you so you know everything that goes into it and can feel comfortable with the process. All locations are owned by the corporation so training, process, and ingredients are consistent. One negative is that there is no place to enter critical dietary restriction information when ordering online or through their app. Guests need to either call the location or visit in-person to communicate any critical dietary restriction needs.</p>",

Additionally, the staff will use clean cambro bins in the back to mix any ice cream orders for critical dietary restrictions to reduce the risk of cross-contact.</p><p>The set up of ice cream, toppings/add-ins, and cones can vary by location. Ice cream and sorbets are in individual bins and generally set up side by side in two rows. The order of the toppings can vary depending on the location. Some stores may put cookie/brownie toppings, tree nuts, and peanuts in the middle, and others may put them off to the side. Toppings are stored in individual covered containers and have their own scoop. The topping station is next to the ice cream station where there are cones and waffle cups above the toppings.</p><p>Ice creams, sorbets, and mix-ins are produced off-site.

Upon request, gloves are changed and hands are washed. Unopened bins or unused product from the back can be used upon request for any guests concerned about cross-contact. You may request one staff member make your order, instead of passing it down the line. All items on the line have dedicated spoons/utensils so that cross-contact risk is reduced.

Eggs are only an ingredient at locations that serve breakfast and only one menu item contains soy. Their allergen and special diets menu is very easy to use and understand and has excellent notes for added detail about ingredients. In addition to the top 8 allergens and gluten, Chipotle provides information for mustard and sulfites, as well as for those following a vegetarian, vegan, whole30, keto, or paleo diet.</p><p>Chipotle is happy to accomodate guests with critical dietary restrictions and looks to the customer for direction on any special handling they would like for their order. Upon request, gloves are changed and hands are washed. Unopened bins or unused product from the back can be used upon request for any guests concerned about cross-contact. You may request one staff member make your order, instead of passing it down the line. All items on the line have dedicated spoons/utensils so that cross-contact risk is reduced. The order is prepared right in front of you so you know everything that goes into it and can feel comfortable with the process. All locations are owned by the corporation so training, process, and ingredients are consistent. One negative is that there is no place to enter critical dietary restriction information when ordering online or through their app. Guests need to either call the location or visit in-person to communicate any critical dietary restriction needs.</p>",

Pizzas are assembled in the kitchen and cooked on trays that go through a conveyor-type oven. All other food items are cooked on trays that go through the same conveyor oven. Since all food items are cooked separately on trays it presents a reduced risk of cross-contact from shared cooking surfaces.

Locations may be willing and able to pull toppings from fresh bins.</p><p>Shakes are premixed, not blended in a blender, and come straight out of a dispenser into the cup. Each shake flavor has its own dedicated tube and these are not rotated, which reduces the risk of cross-contact for shakes.</p>",

The waffle cones contain multiple allergens, including gluten, wheat, soy, eggs, and milk. The waffle irons are located in a separate area from the ice cream tubs and are produced in the morning to reduce risk of cross-contact.</p><p>Their online menu provides an easy-to-use filter to help customers navigate the menu according to their dietary restrictions or preferences, but not every flavor listed online is offered at every location.</p><p>The managers contacted by Picknic showed little knowledge regarding food allergies so you will need to be your own advocate. The procedures for accommodating critical dietary restrictions were not standardized across the reviewed facilities. There were discrepancies in the understanding of company policies and procedures; some locations did not require their employees to wear gloves when scooping ice cream, whereas other locations did require gloves.</p>",

Some locations offer the option to have the critical dietary restriction-friendly meal brought to table on a separate tray from other prepared foods. Managers of the restaurants reviewed by Picknic highlighted the routine hand washing and changing of gloves by the kitchen staff, especially when preparing meals for critical dietary restrictions. The managers are trained on how to handle food allergies.</p><p>Each establishment is provided with resources for both staff and customers to determine what foods can be made or adjusted to fit critical dietary restrictions. As a whole, Chili's managers contacted by Picknic were quick to respond to questions and offer helpful information regarding their procedures and offer ways they could accomodate for a variety of food allergies. However, understanding of food allergies was occasionally inconsistent among the managers we surveyed.</p><p>Chili’s has a complex Allergen/Vegetarian/Vegan Matrix which designates cross-contact and the Top 8 Allergens in every item in addition to those dishes which are vegetarian and Vegan.</p><p>All of their fried foods are made in the same fryer so there are cross-contact risks for all food allergies with their fried menu items. All fish and shellfish food items are cooked in designated pans to reduce the risk of cross-contact with other food items. The fryer oil used varied amongst the restaurants contacted by Picknic but most of the locations used either soybean oil or vegetable oil (most likely soybean oil). The oil used on the flat top grills contained soy at most locations so it is important for customers with a soy allergy to discuss their allergy with a manager before ordering.</p>",

Their allergen and special diets menu is very easy to use and understand and has excellent notes for added detail about ingredients. In addition to the top 8 allergens and gluten, Chipotle provides information for mustard and sulfites, as well as for those following a vegetarian, vegan, whole30, keto, or paleo diet.</p><p>Chipotle is happy to accomodate guests with critical dietary restrictions and looks to the customer for direction on any special handling they would like for their order. Upon request, gloves are changed and hands are washed. Unopened bins or unused product from the back can be used upon request for any guests concerned about cross-contact. You may request one staff member make your order, instead of passing it down the line. All items on the line have dedicated spoons/utensils so that cross-contact risk is reduced. The order is prepared right in front of you so you know everything that goes into it and can feel comfortable with the process. All locations are owned by the corporation so training, process, and ingredients are consistent. One negative is that there is no place to enter critical dietary restriction information when ordering online or through their app. Guests need to either call the location or visit in-person to communicate any critical dietary restriction needs.</p>",

Locations may be willing and able to pull toppings from fresh bins.</p><p>Shakes are premixed, not blended in a blender, and come straight out of a dispenser into the cup.

The staff change their gloves and prepares the pizzas on individual screens to reduce these risks but they cannot guarantee their foods are 100% free of those allergens. Additionally, they do not have separate ovens for different allergens so those with a gluten critical dietary restriction should be aware that their gluten-free pizza may come into contact with gluten-containing items in the oven or on the toppings bar. Some restaurants use stickers to identify gluten-free pizzas that they place on their boxes.</p><p>Overall, Domino's has standardized procedures and a good understanding of critical dietary restrictions.</p>",

Managers of the restaurants reviewed by Picknic highlighted the routine hand washing and changing of gloves by the kitchen staff, especially when preparing meals for critical dietary restrictions. The managers are trained on how to handle food allergies.</p><p>Each establishment is provided with resources for both staff and customers to determine what foods can be made or adjusted to fit critical dietary restrictions. As a whole, Chili's managers contacted by Picknic were quick to respond to questions and offer helpful information regarding their procedures and offer ways they could accomodate for a variety of food allergies. However, understanding of food allergies was occasionally inconsistent among the managers we surveyed.</p><p>Chili’s has a complex Allergen/Vegetarian/Vegan Matrix which designates cross-contact and the Top 8 Allergens in every item in addition to those dishes which are vegetarian and Vegan.</p><p>All of their fried foods are made in the same fryer so there are cross-contact risks for all food allergies with their fried menu items. All fish and shellfish food items are cooked in designated pans to reduce the risk of cross-contact with other food items. The fryer oil used varied amongst the restaurants contacted by Picknic but most of the locations used either soybean oil or vegetable oil (most likely soybean oil). The oil used on the flat top grills contained soy at most locations so it is important for customers with a soy allergy to discuss their allergy with a manager before ordering.</p>",

    "overviewText": "<p>Jamba Juice's online menu lists the ingredients used in each of their menu items and make special note of certain allergens present in their food, including dairy, soy, tree nuts (almond and coconut), wheat, and egg. The smoothies and juices at Jamba Juice allow for some modifications, if necessary, to accomodate for critical dietary restrictions.</p><p>The staff reviewed by Picknic gave consistent responses regarding their procedures for handling critical dietary restrictions and happily answered any questions regarding their menu items and the allergens at their location.</p><p>Picknic believes Jamba Juice is a good option for those with gluten, egg, and wheat critical dietary restrictions because there are few or no blended menu items that contain these allergens. The foods offered that contain wheat, gluten, and egg are specific to their breakfast items, flatbreads, and baked goods which are manufactured and individually packaged outside of the restaurant, stored in a separate refrigerator from their smoothie and juice ingredients, and cooked in an oven that is typically in a separate area from the blenders. Jamba Juice stores do not carry any fish or shellfish products.</p><p>Although there are menu items that are free of peanuts, tree nuts, dairy, and soy, there is an elevated risk risk of cross-contact for these ingredients due to shared blenders.</p>",

Ice cream and sorbets are in individual bins and generally set up side by side in two rows. The order of the toppings can vary depending on the location. Some stores may put cookie/brownie toppings, tree nuts, and peanuts in the middle, and others may put them off to the side. Toppings are stored in individual covered containers and have their own scoop. The topping station is next to the ice cream station where there are cones and waffle cups above the toppings.</p><p>Ice creams, sorbets, and mix-ins are produced off-site.

One cooks fish and chicken, the second cooks red meats and the third grill cooks pancakes, French toast and eggs. Dairy (butter) is used on all grills. The managers contacted by Picknic could not ensure that their grills were completely free of allergens. A few locations were willing to utilize new utensils, clean the grill and/or use pans to prepare foods for those with critical dietary restrictions, but it must be requested by the customer.</p><p>There are three fryers used. One fries fish and chicken and has cross-contact with fish, wheat, and egg. The second cooks breaded items like onion rings and has cross-contact with wheat and egg. The third fries cheese sticks and has cross-contact with dairy, wheat, and egg.</p><p>Denny’s has an informative allergen menu that designates if an item contains or may contain an allergen. There is also cross-contact information on the allergen menu and indicates if the item is processed in a facility or on equipment with an allergen. There is a further breakdown of information about tree nuts (almonds, coconut, hazelnut) and fish (anchovies, cod/pollock/white fish, salmon).</p><p>In summary, they have a wide menu, willingness to accommodate dietary restrictions, and an online allergen guide.

Additionally, they do not have separate ovens for different allergens so those with a gluten critical dietary restriction should be aware that their gluten-free pizza may come into contact with gluten-containing items in the oven or on the toppings bar.

    "overviewText": "<p>Chili's extensive menu allows for many people with critical dietary restrictions to find food options suitable for them. For those with allergies, the staff is willing to accommodate as best they can by omitting ingredients accordingly and using fresh utensils when preparing the food.</p><p>It is important to inform your server of your food allergy immediately or make note of the allergy when ordering online. Some locations offer the option to have the critical dietary restriction-friendly meal brought to table on a separate tray from other prepared foods. Managers of the restaurants reviewed by Picknic highlighted the routine hand washing and changing of gloves by the kitchen staff, especially when preparing meals for critical dietary restrictions. The managers are trained on how to handle food allergies.</p><p>Each establishment is provided with resources for both staff and customers to determine what foods can be made or adjusted to fit critical dietary restrictions. As a whole, Chili's managers contacted by Picknic were quick to respond to questions and offer helpful information regarding their procedures and offer ways they could accomodate for a variety of food allergies. However, understanding of food allergies was occasionally inconsistent among the managers we surveyed.</p><p>Chili’s has a complex Allergen/Vegetarian/Vegan Matrix which designates cross-contact and the Top 8 Allergens in every item in addition to those dishes which are vegetarian and Vegan.</p><p>All of their fried foods are made in the same fryer so there are cross-contact risks for all food allergies with their fried menu items. All fish and shellfish food items are cooked in designated pans to reduce the risk of cross-contact with other food items. The fryer oil used varied amongst the restaurants contacted by Picknic but most of the locations used either soybean oil or vegetable oil (most likely soybean oil). The oil used on the flat top grills contained soy at most locations so it is important for customers with a soy allergy to discuss their allergy with a manager before ordering.</p>",

Upon request, gloves are changed and hands are washed. Unopened bins or unused product from the back can be used upon request for any guests concerned about cross-contact. You may request one staff member make your order, instead of passing it down the line. All items on the line have dedicated spoons/utensils so that cross-contact risk is reduced. The order is prepared right in front of you so you know everything that goes into it and can feel comfortable with the process. All locations are owned by the corporation so training, process, and ingredients are consistent. One negative is that there is no place to enter critical dietary restriction information when ordering online or through their app. Guests need to either call the location or visit in-person to communicate any critical dietary restriction needs.</p>",

One cooks fish and chicken, the second cooks red meats and the third grill cooks pancakes, French toast and eggs. Dairy (butter) is used on all grills. The managers contacted by Picknic could not ensure that their grills were completely free of allergens. A few locations were willing to utilize new utensils, clean the grill and/or use pans to prepare foods for those with critical dietary restrictions, but it must be requested by the customer.</p><p>There are three fryers used. One fries fish and chicken and has cross-contact with fish, wheat, and egg. The second cooks breaded items like onion rings and has cross-contact with wheat and egg. The third fries cheese sticks and has cross-contact with dairy, wheat, and egg.</p><p>Denny’s has an informative allergen menu that designates if an item contains or may contain an allergen. There is also cross-contact information on the allergen menu and indicates if the item is processed in a facility or on equipment with an allergen. There is a further breakdown of information about tree nuts (almonds, coconut, hazelnut) and fish (anchovies, cod/pollock/white fish, salmon).</p><p>In summary, they have a wide menu, willingness to accommodate dietary restrictions, and an online allergen guide. However, their knowledge of critical dietary restrictions varied between locations and the restaurant chain does not have consistent procedures for handling critical dietary restrictions in the restaurants.</p>",
